                        <p>What's this? Remember us? You might have memories visiting the original Mega Man XZ: The Maverick Hunters website, originating way back in 2000 and calling Zophar's Domain its home for more than ten years. Well, after remaining static for just as long, the site has been completely renovated and refreshed with this new look.</p>
                        <p>We've been out of the Mega Man gaming scene for some time - let's see, there's been a Mega Man 9 and 10, and Mega Man-creator Keiji Inafune has since departed Capcom and started up his own gaming company. The current crop of Nintendo consoles (Wii / Wii U / 3DS) are also home to a stack of classic Mega Man titles thanks to the awesome Virtual Console.</p>
                        <p>I should start by saying that this site will now act as an archive for all of our existing guides. I currently don't have any plans to add new guides to the roster. The main goal of this project was to future-proof the site and clean up all the messy HTML code, ensuring that it should still work with future web browsers and devices.</p>
                        <p>I hope you enjoy the new look of the site! Hopefully it can bring back a positive Mega Man-gaming memory or two of years gone by. The Mega Man series might not be on Capcom's plate these days, but the Blue Bomber will always be close to our hearts. Enjoy!</p>
